# credit-risk-classification

This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook that develops a loan approval model based on data of defaults. A logistic regression model is first developed using a selection of training data. Then a model is developed using a different set of data. Both models show strong results, suggesting that they are predictive and can be used in production. Outputs are shown for each model to show their strength.
